# Youtube Player

Control Youtube from your toolbar, with ease.

Features:
* Looks up the first open Youtube tab and starts playing the first song in it.
* Opens a new tab when it can’t find one
* Skip to next or previous song
* Uses the Youtube in-page event hub to track player status
* Localizable (standard SDK feature)
* Support for OSX media keys and Apple Remote - thanks to Markus Stange!
  * Check out his project at https://github.com/mstange/mediakeysappleremotesimfy
* Repo contains some tools that I built around it to make creating future add-ons easier:
  * CSS pre-processor, so you can write Mozilla-style CSS(tm): %define, %ifdef…else…endif
  * variable substitution
  * and more fun stuff.
  * Simple abstraction for writing wide-widget add-ons.
  * No docs. Yet. :-/
